# Conway's Game of Life Console Simulation

This project is a Python-based simulation of Conway's Game of Life that runs in the console. The game displays a grid where each cell can be alive (`#`) or dead (` `), and evolves over time according to specific rules.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x

To verify that Python is installed, run:

```
python --version
```

### Installing

You can follow these steps to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository or download the `game.py` file.
   
   ```
   https://github.com/Guereak/game-of-life-Maxime-LANGELIER-CDOF1
   cd game-of-life-Maxime-LANGELIER-CDOF1
   ```

2. Install required dependencies

   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```

### Running the Game

1. Run the Python script:

   ```
   python game.py
   ```

### Coding style tests

Ensure that the code adheres to PEP 8 guidelines. You can use tools like `flake8` to check:

```bash
pip install flake8
flake8 game.py
```

## Deployment

This project is designed to run locally in a console environment. For deployment in other environments (e.g., a web-based interface), additional work would be required.
